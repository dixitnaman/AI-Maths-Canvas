# AI-Maths-Canvas

Overview
The Math Canvas Calculator is an AI-powered tool that allows users to draw mathematical expressions on a digital canvas. The application processes the handwritten input, extracts the equation, solves it using AI, and returns the computed result in real-time.
It integrates React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and Gemini Flash AI API for high-accuracy equation solving. By leveraging handwriting recognition (OCR) and AI, the calculator provides an intuitive and seamless experience for solving handwritten math problems.
Technologies Used
